        I have a strong passion for developer so I decided to improve my skill set by completing a 
        Full Stack Development Program. During the program, I learned various software skills such as
        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, SQLite, and ReactJS. I successfully completed projects
            that replicated real-time applications, gaining practical experience. With a passion for 
            creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, I am committed to creating engaging
        digital experiences that meet the needs of clients and end-users. As a highly adaptable and
        detail-oriented team player, I am eager to bring my skills to contribute to the success of a dynamic organization.
